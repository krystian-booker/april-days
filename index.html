					My name is Nan Ma (April). I graduated with a master's degree in social work from McMaster
					University. I am a registered social worker with the Ontario College of Social Workers and
					Social Services Workers (OCSWSSW, Registration #828927), and a member in good standing with
					the Ontario Association of Social Workers (OASW). With professional training and practice, I
					am skilled in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, and Couple
					Therapy (Certified Gottman Therapist). Also, I can provide counseling services in both
					Mandarin and English.
					<br />
					<br />
					I have eight years of professional experience in relevant organizations, providing support
					and counseling services to individuals, couples, and families of different ages and groups.
					I am working with people who experience PTSD, such as car accidents and other huge changes
					or events in their life. Social work counseling can help in rebuilding self-confidence to
					face difficulties.
					<br />
					<br />
					I have a deep understanding of life transitions, no matter it positive or negative, location
					changes, and role changes. Because I was an international student and experienced some
					challenges with adjustment in academic and daily life. I would like to use my knowledge and
					skills to support and help more international students, immigrants, and their families to
					have a better life in Canada.
					<br />
					<br />
					Please let me know if you feel alone, sad, frustrated, and disappointed and book a 20-mins
					free session. I will be a great listener and give you a safe space and moment to speak out.
					Then, we can move to systemic mental health counseling. You will know more about yourself,
					learn some skills to deal with your emotions, and improve your abilities in communication
					and problem-solving.

						<h3>A name</h3>
						<p>April is my English name since I was born in April. It is a time of life and hope. A Chinese
							poem by Huiyin Lin, named 'You Are the April of This World,' shows how beautiful life is. I
							hope everyone can enjoy such a great moment with a gentle wind, blinking stars, light rain,
							budding flowers, and full of love, warmth, and hope.
							<br /><br />
							Also, from my view, everyone has his/her noticeable qualities, as well as some flaws. For
							example, one of my favorite characters in Grey's Anatomy is April Kepner, a female trauma
							surgeon who is strong, confident, competitive, compassionate, and understanding but
							emotional and easily anxious. Most clients come to me due to their difficulties, crisis, and
							negative parts of their life.
							<br />
							<br />
							My job is to help you find more advantages and positive
							personalities to overcome difficulties and challenge yourself.

						<h3>You Are the April of This World <br /> Ode to Love</h3>
						<h4>Lin Huiyin</h4>
						<h5>Translated by Xinqu Huang</h5>
						<pre class="poem">
I think you are the April of this world,
Sure, you are the April of this world.
Your laughter has lit up all the wind,
So gently mingling with the spring.
You are the clouds in early spring,
The dusk wind blows up and down.
And the stars blink now and then,
Fine rain drops down amid the flowers.
So gentle and graceful,
You are crowned with garlands.
So sublime and innocent,
You are a full moon over each evening.
The snow melts, with that light yellow,
You look like the first budding green.
You are the soft joy of white lotus
Rising up in your fancy dreamland.
You're the blooming flowers over the trees,
You're a swallow twittering between the beams;
Full of love, full of warm hope,
You are the spring of this world!
