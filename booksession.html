				<h2>About April</h2>
				<p> My name is Nan Ma (April). I graduated with a master's degree in social work from McMaster
					University. I am a registered social worker with the Ontario College of Social Workers and
					Social Services Workers (OCSWSSW, Registration #828927), and a member in good standing with
					the Ontario Association of Social Workers (OASW). With professional training and practice, I
					am skilled in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, and Couple
					Therapy (Certified Gottman Therapist). Also, I can provide counseling services in both
					Mandarin and English.
					<br />
					<br />
					I have eight years of professional experience in relevant organizations, providing support
					and counseling services to individuals, couples, and families of different ages and groups.
					I am working with people who experience PTSD, such as car accidents and other huge changes
					or events in their life. Social work counseling can help in rebuilding self-confidence to
					face difficulties.
					<br />
					<br />
					I have a deep understanding of life transitions, no matter it positive or negative, location
					changes, and role changes. Because I was an international student and experienced some
					challenges with adjustment in academic and daily life. I would like to use my knowledge and
					skills to support and help more international students, immigrants, and their families to
					have a better life in Canada.
					<br />
					<br />
					Please let me know if you feel alone, sad, frustrated, and disappointed and book a 20-mins
					free session. I will be a great listener and give you a safe space and moment to speak out.
					Then, we can move to systemic mental health counseling. You will know more about yourself,
					learn some skills to deal with your emotions, and improve your abilities in communication
					and problem-solving.
